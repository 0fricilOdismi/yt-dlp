One of the products in this catalog is Microsoft Musical Instruments, a multimedia software that was released in 1992. It was designed to teach users about the history, sound, and structure of various musical instruments from around the world. Users could explore different categories of instruments, such as strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, keyboards, and electronic. They could also listen to samples of music played by each instrument, view photos and videos of musicians and performers, and learn about the origins and evolution of musical styles and genres.
  
Microsoft Musical Instruments was compatible with Windows 3.1 and later versions. It required a CD-ROM drive, a sound card, and a mouse to run. It also supported MIDI devices, such as keyboards and synthesizers, that could be connected to the computer and used to play along with the software. The software came with a user guide, a reference card, and a poster that showed the layout of the instruments on the screen.
  
The software received positive reviews from critics and users who praised its educational value, interactivity, and quality of sound and graphics. However, it also faced some competition from other similar products in the market, such as The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments by Dorling Kindersley and The Complete Mozart by Voyager. Microsoft Musical Instruments was discontinued in 1995 and is no longer supported by Microsoft.
