Assassin's Creed Revelations is the fourth installment in the popular action-adventure series that follows the exploits of various Assassins throughout history. The game features two protagonists: Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who seeks to uncover the secrets of his ancestor AltaÃ¯r Ibn-La'Ahad in 16th century Constantinople, and Desmond Miles, who relives Ezio's memories through a device called the Animus in the present day.
 
The Lost Archive is a downloadable content (DLC) addition for Assassin's Creed Revelations that was released on February 28, 2012. It offers a new gameplay experience similar to the Desmond's Journey sequences, where the player controls a virtual construct of Clay Kaczmarek, also known as Subject 16 of the Animus Project. The DLC explores Clay's life as an Assassin, his infiltration of Abstergo Industries, and his discovery of the Templars' plan to use a Piece of Eden to control humanity.
