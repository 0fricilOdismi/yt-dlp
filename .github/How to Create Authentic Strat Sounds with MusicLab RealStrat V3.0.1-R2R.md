MusicLab RealStrat V3.0.1-R2R is based on high quality dry samples of each fret of all strings directly from Stratocaster pickups, which let you easily create any desired guitar sound using your favorite amplifier simulator. It also includes not only sustain sounds, but also other guitar-specific sounds with dynamics and nuances an experienced performer can get from his/her instrument, such as slides, bends, vibrato, harmonics, mutes, noises, and more.
 
MusicLab RealStrat V3.0.1-R2R also offers three ways of using the virtual instrument: intuitive keyboard layout that allows live/MIDI keyboard performance with numerous articulations, noises, guitar-specific tricks, strumming and finger picking techniques; built-in song sequencer that lets you arrange up to the entire song by simply inserting chord symbols and selecting pre-recorded guitar rhythm patterns; and MIDI output mode that enables you to use RealStrat as a powerful MIDI controller to drive any other guitar software or hardware.
